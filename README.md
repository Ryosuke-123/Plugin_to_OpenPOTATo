## Introduction
　Open POTATo is a platform software that integrates a variety of tools for fNIRS data analysis. Open POTATo performs the analysis by selecting the fNIRS measurement data the setting the analysis method and drawing method. <br>
　Motion Artifact can significantly influence the quality the recorded optical signals of fNIRS. Therefore, we have developed a plug-in that correct Motion Artifact for Open POTATo. <br>

## Apps
The following is a quick overview of the apps. Further documentation is available within the apps themselves.

### Example 1: Motion artifact detection by sobel filter
